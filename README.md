# PAP Project
A small 3D game demo made in Unity for my course's final evaluation (PAP)

Notes:
```
-use the '\' key to open up console, type "help" to get a list of commands
-navigate menus with WASD and ESC or Backspace to go back a menu page | move player with WASD and Spacebar to jump.
```

The controls *can* be changed, but it's an old implementation so not every key is remappable (an example would be the menu navigation keys, however the player movement keys work), plus the UI isn't very keyboard friendly and is overall unfinished.
